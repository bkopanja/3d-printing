# Important

All profiles are tested and used on daily basis on Simplify3d v4.0.1 as I'm still waiting for v4.1 to become more stable. However I see no reason for them not to work on v4.1 as well but they might need some fine tuning for optimal performance

# Disclamer

Please note that this folder contains things that work for me.

I have a Wahnao Duplicator i3 v2.1 upgraded to RAMPS1.4 (so this is not Melzi board) with MicroSwiss all metal hotend (so retraction is set super low compared to someone with a bowden extruder or a stock one for this particular 3d printer)

If you have a similar setup, this might work for you.


I've bought Ender 3 recently so I've started adding Ender 3 related things as well
so if you have it, feel free to check out new goodies as well.

My Ender 3 has again lots of udates (MKS Gen 1.4 board, Microswiss all metal hotend etc.)
so some things might not work for you but you can at least use most of the stuff here
as a starting point
