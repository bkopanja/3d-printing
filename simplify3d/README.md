# Important

All profiles are tested and used on daily basis on Simplify3d v4.0.1 as I'm still waiting for v4.1 to become more stable. However I see no reason for them not to work on v4.1 as well but they might need some fine tuning for optimal performance

# Disclamer

Please note that this folder contains things that work for me.

I have a Wahnao Duplicator i3 v2.1 upgraded to RAMPS1.4 (so this is not Melzi board) with MicroSwiss all metal hotend (so retraction is set super low compared to someone with a bowden extruder or a stock one for this particular 3d printer)

If you have a similar setup, this might work for you.
