# Wanhao-Duplicator-i3-S3D-stuff

Please make note that this repo holds configurations for 
Wanhao Duplicator i3 for Simplify3D BUT it's not a stock
printer, I've upgraded the Melzi board with RAMPS 1.4 so
This might not be optimal for the stock one. This is just
what works nice for me and I wanted to share it with
other people so it hopefully can be useful for someone
else or at least used as a starting point.
