# Disclamer

Please note that this folder contains things that work for me.

I have a Wahnao Duplicator i3 v2.1 upgraded to RAMPS1.4 (so this is not Melzi board)
with MicroSwiss all metal hotend (so retraction is set super low compared
to someone with a bowden extruder or a stock one for this particular 3d printer)

If you have similar setup like I do, this might work for you.
