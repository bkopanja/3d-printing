# Important

Script named "AddUserPermissionsCura.sh" is something that i used on Linux Mint 19 and I guess that it will work for most similar distribution (Ubuntu/Debian etc) and it's made for currently latest version of Cura which is 3.6

I had issues with running the AppImage of cura without this (it was working only for `root` user) so if you have issues with starting Cura on a Linux or if it can't wirte config/profile files this is probably the solution you need.

# Disclamer

Please note that this folder contains things that work for me.

I have a Wahnao Duplicator i3 v2.1 upgraded to RAMPS1.4 (so this is not Melzi board)
with MicroSwiss all metal hotend (so retraction is set super low compared
to someone with a bowden extruder or a stock one for this particular 3d printer)

If you have similar setup like I do, this might work for you.
